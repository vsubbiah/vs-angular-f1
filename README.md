# vs-angular-f1

Was follwing RAONI BOAVENTURA's tutorial at [1] and committed changes along the way. I started of with some minimal files from [2] as opposed to just cloning that whole repo as a starting point. This maybe useful to you if if you want to see incremental changesm without having to type them out.
